#User-Login-Flask

make sure to have these installed 

- flask 
- flask_sqlalchemy 
- flask_login 
- flask_bcrypt 
- flask-WTF 
- wtforms 
- email_validator 

To run:
python3 app.py

database is immediately created when the code is ran + 10 test users are populated as well

unfortunately, I was unable to utilize React for the frontend because I was more focused on meeting the functional requirements. I've never used flask or React before so this project had a learning curve for me, but it was extremely valuable and I'm excited to learn more! 

if you have any questions, I'm happy to demo!!
Have a nice day!
